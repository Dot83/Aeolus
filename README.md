# Aeolus

This directory contains the code Aeolus in the (closest of its) form(s) that was used for the paper XXX.
The code is not documented, and not supported in any way (yet), so we do not advice that you use it on your own. 
At some point in the - not too far - future a user-friendly version of the code will be made available.
